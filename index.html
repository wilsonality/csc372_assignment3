                    Hello! My name is Wilson Gachunga, and I am a Spartan foodie 
                    who's experienced in the ins and outs of dining on campus. 
                    Greensboro is an amazing city with tons of food to offer.

                      grabbing delicious eats on campus!

                    Now, now. There's so many places to choose from on campus. 
                    I know you're thinking, "Man, I'm hungry. Where should I go?"

                    Luckily for you, this page has come to save you! These three 
                    spots are my go-tos. In my semesters at UNCG, I've learned 
                    through trial and error where to get the most bang for your 
                    buck, or flavor for your fork, in culinary terms.

                    This Indian Restaurant is my favorite spot for a late-night 
                    warm meal, especially during finals. They have a great menu of 
                    hearty stews, with options for vegetarians. Plus: the naan is 
                    to die for!

                        <p>Butter chicken is a staple south asian dish. The dish 
                            consists of chicken in a creamy, flavorful tomato sauce, 
                            typically served with white rice.

                            Lamb saag is a wonderful curry dish that uses spinach for 
                            beautiful color, with lamb for delicious flavor in each bite. 
                            Raaz Indian Kitchen has an amazing lamb saag that you can 
                            trust is a repeat order for me.

                            Does it need to be explained? Raaz's naan bread is my 
                            favorite item on their menu, hands down. It's so decadent, 
                            warm, and perfect for pairing with their curries. They offer 
                            plain, garlic, and butter variations.
                        </p>
                        <p class="italic">Tip: My favorite is the garlic naan. It's 
                            sooooo good with the butter chicken.

                    not too far, just in the right spot. Head to the corner of Highland
